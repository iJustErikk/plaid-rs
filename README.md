# Usage
```rust
use plaid::PlaidClient;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let client = PlaidClient::from_env();
    // Add this middleware to record requests, e.g. for testing.
    // Do not use the middleware in production!
    // .with_middleware(httpclient::middleware::RecorderMiddleware::new());
    let access_token = "access-sandbox-b4957595-eae2-4130-9da7-114d14726a62";
    let item_get = client.item_get(access_token)
        .send()
        .await
        .unwrap();
    println!("{:#?}", item_get);
}
```

This example loads the client from the environment variables, specifically:

* `PLAID_CLIENT_ID`
* `PLAID_SECRET`
* `PLAID_VERSION`
* `PLAID_ENV`: one of `sandbox`, `development`, or `production`
